REQUIREMENTS

To compile bluecherry-client on MasOSX install following applications:

* XCode with Command Line utils
* MacPorts

Using MacPorts install following packages:
* git-core
* cmake
* wget

Download  bluecherry-client-scripts package from git and install ffmpeg and Qt:

- git clone git://github.com/vogel/bluecherry-client-scripts.git
- cd bluecherry-client-scripts/dependencies
- ./install-ffmpeg-macosx.sh
- ./install-qt-macosx.sh

This script will automatically download more required MacPorts packages.

Next step is to configure cmake - copy macosx.cmake file to user.cmake and adjust
values appropriately.

Next configure and compile your source code:

- export QTPATH=$HOME/dev/user
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake {path to bluecherry-client sources}
- make
- make deploy
- cd ..
- ./mac/package.sh build

Bluecherry-client should be compiled by GCC. If Clang is used by default, put CXX=/usr/bin/g++ before calling cmake
