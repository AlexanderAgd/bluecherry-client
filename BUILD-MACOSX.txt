REQUIREMENTS

To compile bluecherry-client on MasOSX install following applications:

* XCode with Command Line utils
* MacPorts

Using MacPorts install following packages:
* git-core
* cmake
* wget

Download  bluecherry-client-scripts package from git and install ffmpeg and Qt:
```
git clone git://github.com/bluecherrydvr/bluecherry-client-scripts
cd bluecherry-client-scripts/dependencies
./install-qt-macosx.sh
```
This script will automatically download more required MacPorts packages.

Next step is to configure cmake - copy macosx.cmake file to user.cmake and adjust
values appropriately.

Next configure and compile your source code:
```
# export QTPATH=$HOME/dev/user
export PATH="$HOME/dev/usr/bin:${PATH}"

mkdir build
cd build
PATH="$HOME/dev/usr/bin:${PATH}" CXX=/usr/bin/g++ cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=off -DENABLE_BREAKPAD=off {path to bluecherry-client sources}
make mplayer
CXXFLAGS="-arch i386" CFLAGS="-arch i386" LDFLAGS="-arch i386" CXX=/usr/bin/g++ make ffmpeg bluecherry-client
make deploy
cd {path to bluecherry-client SOURCES}
./mac/package.sh {path to BUILD_DIR}

NOTES: Bluecherry-client should be compiled by GCC. If Clang is used by default, put CXX=/usr/bin/g++ before calling cmake.
After "make deploy" run "otool -L bluecherry-client.app/Contents/MacOS/bluecherry-client" and make sure all non-system
dependencies reference libraries inside bundle
